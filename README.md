## [Cryptopals Challenge](https://www.cryptopals.com/)

My attempt to solve the riddles. And doing so in Lua! Why Lua, you ask? It's big in embedded systems and I'm now in 
embedded. Do I like it? Yeah, doesn't seem to bad, tbh. Does it bother me that the index doesn't start at 0? 
Not as much as I tought. 

This thing would probably not run on your machine, because you need to compile OpenSSL and place it somewhere I forgot. 
Lua can call C with very little overhead, which is a huge selling point.

Cryptopals gives a nice introduction to read-world crypto. Especially, breaking CBC was kind of tricky.
